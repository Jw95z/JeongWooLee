Shows a list. Has name of variables and describes the data in the list. 1/1 Managing Complexity a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program How list manages complexity by explaining why the list have to written or what code will change without lists I think my code is pretty complex because it connects 5 different code. The list will be pulling data from database 1/1 Procedural Abstraction Two program code segment - One provident that shows at least one effect parameter in the procedure - one showing about calling of student’s procedure Has code segment showing the student-developed procedure and has parameter and shows where the SDP is being called. Finally describes the functionality of the program well. 1/1 Algorithm Implementation Sequencing Selection Iteration Describes what identified procedure is and how it contributes to overall functionality I have sequencing for all the code and iteration for running APi and selection for the login thing in my personal site. 1/1 Testing Describes two calls that pass different argument and cause different result Conditions tested by each call result of each call Two different values that one is correct login and another is incorrect login is putting in the login site The conditions will be username and password is correct. Right username and password will be go to main page and wrong will be go different page. 1/1]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Title</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/2023/02/09/model.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Title" /><published>2023-02-09T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-09T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/2023/02/09/model</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Project Plan</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/projectplan/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Project Plan" /><published>2023-02-06T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-02-06T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/projectplan</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Assignment" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Project plan Login and registration is my plan.
