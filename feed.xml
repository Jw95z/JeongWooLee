Other input is related to login. We have to verify that it’s right Id and password. Program functionality is to save the data in the proper database. Main goal of my program is to make login and register function 1/1 1/1 Data Abstraction Two code segments - one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type) - one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose Name of the variables representing the list being used in response what the data contained in this list is representing in the program The variables is username, password, age, weigh, and name. Users put the value in the variables and it will be in the database. The values will be saved as lists to make sure to pick up when it’s necessary. 1/1 1/1 Managing Complexity a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program How list manages complexity by explaining why the list have to written or what code will change without lists There is a code that shows the list and pull values from it 1/1 1/1 Procedural Abstraction Two program code segment - One provident that shows at least one effect parameter in the procedure - one showing about calling of student’s procedure There is a parameter in the function so that it will send the value in the direct order. 1/1 1/1 Algorithm Implementation Sequencing Selection Iteration Describes what identified procedure is and how it contributes to overall functionality It has sequencing, iteration, and selection. Selection is for matching ID and password, and iteration is for pulling all the values in database to match it. I will write sentences that explains how the code works. 1/1 1/1 Testing Describes two calls that pass different argument and cause different result Conditions tested by each call result of each call I will test it when all the code is written. two call is for login and register. Besides, they also have a different result for it. One is for saving data and other is for verifying Id and password 1/1 1/1]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">5.1 and 5.2 blog</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/5.1and5.2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="5.1 and 5.2 blog" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/5.1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Notes_from_video" /><category term="Assignment" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Notes from 5.1 Not every effect of computing innovation is anticipated in advance. Single effects can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person. ex) you can think Wii is great, but sometimes it is dangerous. People create computing innovations. Even though 3D printer can make itself, someone has to make original 3D printer. Also, human have to put the parts together which are made by 3D printer. Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts Example of beneficial and harmful effects Multirotor benefit: Deliveries, finding people, aerial photography is easy harmful: privacy concerns, flying some zone is illegal and dangerous Wii controller benefit: make people active due to playing video games harmful: Broken TV’s injuries]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Test Score</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/mcq2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Test Score" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/mcq2</id><author><name></name></author><category term="MCQ" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Title</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/2023/01/30/model.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Title" /><published>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-30T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/2023/01/30/model</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">College Board Score3</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/CollegeBoardGrading3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="College Board Score3" /><published>2023-01-23T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/Grading3</id><author><name></name></author><category term="College Board Grading" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reporting Category Scoring Criteria Comments Student Score College Board Score Program Purpose and Function Input Program Functionality Output Main goal in the program Functionality demonstrated in video Input and output shown in the video Program has both an input and output. It describes it’s purpose as finding information about a triangle and its function as showing the triangle ratios of a triangle that has been inputted. 1/1 0/1 Data Abstraction Two code segments - one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type) - one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose Name of the variables representing the list being used in response what the data contained in this list is representing in the program Has a code segment that shows the arithmetic that calculates the triangle ratios. Shows a list. Has name of variables and describes the data in the list. 1/1 1/1 Managing Complexity a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program How list manages complexity by explaining why the list have to written or what code will change without lists Has code segment shoring the complexity but doesn’t explain it. They just gave another piece of code. 0/1 0/1 Procedural Abstraction Two program code segment - One provident that shows at least one effect parameter in the procedure - one showing about calling of student’s procedure Has code segment showing the student-developed procedure and has parameter and shows where the SDP is being called. Finally describes the functionality of the program well. 1/1 1/1 Algorithm Implementation Sequencing Selection Iteration Describes what identified procedure is and how it contributes to overall functionality Has sequencing, selection but no iteration or explanation. 0/1 0/1 Testing Describes two calls that pass different argument and cause different result Conditions tested by each call result of each call Doesn’t have two calls to the selected procedure only has noe. It does describe the condition and identify the result however. 0/1 0/1]]></summary></entry></feed>
