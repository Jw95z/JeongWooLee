Skills you have obtained Before this class, I had no knowledge of coding, but through this class, I learned how to communicate with others and understand code. I wasn’t good at coding. Therefore, in the second semester, I always stayed up all night to finish assignments or watched YouTube videos to broaden my knowledge of coding. Then, at some point, I came to understand the algorithm. Understanding the algorithm made me realize how the code worked and I could easily complete the assignment. 2. highs and lows from year In the first semester, when I was doing computer science, I was in so much pain. I didn’t know much about API and eventually passed with an A, but at the beginning of the second semester, I thought about giving up the computer science class. However, at the beginning of the second semester, there was a project about Lee Jin-soo, and the teacher liked what I made, so our team was barely able to get a perfect score. Then I thought I should take up computer science again. Then, there was a project at the end of the second semester, and I got high grades there, so I became interested in computer science in earnest. My grade was 91% in the first semester, but it rose to 97% in the second semester. I feel that my skills have improved so much that I can raise 6% in one semester. 3. Future plans with CompSci I am in 11th grade now. Sooner or later, you will have to look into college and there will be a lot of things to prepare for. I recently came to the United States from another country. Therefore, I didn’t prepare much for college preparation compared to other students. I still want to go to college and major in computer science. And if possible, I want to go into game design. Ever since I was little, I wanted to get a job in gaming. My future in computer science is to go to university and study computer science and develop game engines or get hired as a programmer for a well-known game company. 4. future plans in Education/Career Now I am looking for a lot of programs about coding. Besides, I teach coding to students during summer vacation and now I am doing an internship at a coding academy. I think what is lacking for me now is experience, so I will look at the algorithm as much as possible by looking at the code. Besides, I’m trying to take a lot of coding lectures now. Also, I think I need to know about computers in order to know more about computer science, so I am working as a volunteer at a computer fixing place.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Title</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/2023/06/07/model.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Title" /><published>2023-06-07T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-06-07T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/2023/06/07/model</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">JavaScript Api</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/javaapi" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JavaScript Api" /><published>2023-06-01T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-06-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/javaapi</id><author><name></name></author><category term="javascript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">JavaScript Tutorial</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/techtalk/javascript" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="JavaScript Tutorial" /><published>2023-05-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/techtalk/PBL-javascript_tutorial</id><author><name></name></author><category term="1.A" /><category term="3.B" /><category term="C4.0" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick launch into Variables, Functions, Arrays, Classes, HTML.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/images/javascript.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/images/javascript.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Python 2D Iteration and Animation</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/1.d/2.b/3.b/c3.1/2023/05/16/DS-arrays_lab.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Python 2D Iteration and Animation" /><published>2023-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-05-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/1.d/2.b/3.b/c3.1/2023/05/16/DS-arrays_lab</id><author><name></name></author><category term="1.D" /><category term="2.B" /><category term="3.B" /><category term="C3.1" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Several 2D arrays and Animations hacks are provided to further learn iteration and data in Python.
