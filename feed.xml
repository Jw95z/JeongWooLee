Single effects can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person. ex) you can think Wii is great, but sometimes it is dangerous. People create computing innovations. Even though 3D printer can make itself, someone has to make original 3D printer. Also, human have to put the parts together which are made by 3D printer. Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts Example of beneficial and harmful effects Multirotor benefit: Deliveries, finding people, aerial photography is easy harmful: privacy concerns, flying some zone is illegal and dangerous Wii controller benefit: make people active due to playing video games harmful: Broken TV’s injuries]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">College Board Score3</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/CollegeBoardGrading3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="College Board Score3" /><published>2023-01-23T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/Grading3</id><author><name></name></author><category term="College Board Grading" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reporting Category Scoring Criteria Comments Student Score College Board Score Program Purpose and Function Input Program Functionality Output Main goal in the program Functionality demonstrated in video Input and output shown in the video Program has both an input and output. It describes it’s purpose as finding information about a triangle and its function as showing the triangle ratios of a triangle that has been inputted. 1/1 0/1 Data Abstraction Two code segments - one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type) - one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose Name of the variables representing the list being used in response what the data contained in this list is representing in the program Has a code segment that shows the arithmetic that calculates the triangle ratios. Shows a list. Has name of variables and describes the data in the list. 1/1 1/1 Managing Complexity a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program How list manages complexity by explaining why the list have to written or what code will change without lists Has code segment shoring the complexity but doesn’t explain it. They just gave another piece of code. 0/1 0/1 Procedural Abstraction Two program code segment - One provident that shows at least one effect parameter in the procedure - one showing about calling of student’s procedure Has code segment showing the student-developed procedure and has parameter and shows where the SDP is being called. Finally describes the functionality of the program well. 1/1 1/1 Algorithm Implementation Sequencing Selection Iteration Describes what identified procedure is and how it contributes to overall functionality Has sequencing, selection but no iteration or explanation. 0/1 0/1 Testing Describes two calls that pass different argument and cause different result Conditions tested by each call result of each call Doesn’t have two calls to the selected procedure only has noe. It does describe the condition and identify the result however. 0/1 0/1]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">College Board Score2</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/CollegeBoardGrading2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="College Board Score2" /><published>2023-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/Grading2</id><author><name></name></author><category term="College Board Grading" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reporting Category Scoring Criteria Comments Student Score College Board Score Program Purpose and Function Input Program Functionality Output Main goal in the program Functionality demonstrated in video Input and output shown in the video I think the purpose and input are clear, but how it works is not clear.

The student describes about the list and what happens while not using list. 1/1 0/1 Procedural Abstraction Two program code segment - One provident that shows at least one effect parameter in the procedure - one showing about calling of student’s procedure The Program has a parameter and it affects the functionality but doesn’t have a code segment showing this parameter or describe it. 0/1 0/1 Algorithm Implementation Sequencing Selection Iteration Describes what identified procedure is and how it contributes to overall functionality I saw selection and iteration on this code, but one is missing. I cannot see sequencing in this code. Also, the students didn’t explain about functionality 0/1 0/1 Testing Describes two calls that pass different argument and cause different result Conditions tested by each call result of each call Fist call is about correct answer and second one is about wrong answer. There is two conditions which is required. Lastly, it tells the results about first call and second call 1/1 1/1]]></summary></entry></feed>
