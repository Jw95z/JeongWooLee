When the person enter three input, the degree of triangle with three inputs and table of sin, cos, tanz will be come out. However, the purpose is not that long. I want this student to write more specific. It would be better when this student writes why he makes or what he want to get. 0/1 0/1 Data Abstraction Two code segments - one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type) - one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose Name of the variables representing the list being used in response what the data contained in this list is representing in the program Two code segments are shown. One is for the list and other is for how to use the list in procedure. This student defines the list well and explain how the list uses by giving the example in those codes. 1/1 1/1 Managing Complexity a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program How list manages complexity by explaining why the list have to written or what code will change without lists The code segment that contains list is not included in this response. There is a word about why the list makes more complicate. 0/1 0/1 Procedural Abstraction Two program code segment - One provident that shows at least one effect parameter in the procedure - one showing about calling of student’s procedure This student shows the code with three parameter and explains about the function called ratioCalculate. Besides, he shows full code so that it can make teacher to understand easily. 1/1 1/1 Algorithm Implementation Sequencing Selection Iteration Describes what identified procedure is and how it contributes to overall functionality This student uses the word conditionals, so I can see that student utilizes the selection. And there is order because A, B, and C have to be inputted. This student also portrays the steps very easily to comprehend, so person like me can also read this. 1/1 1/1 Testing Describes two calls that pass different argument and cause different result Conditions tested by each call result of each call Results of each call are indicated and Conditions too. Inside the conditions, there are parameters too. At last, this students also expresses two calls which are ratioCalculate(3.0, 4.0, 5.0) and ratioCalculate(1.2, 2.3, 3.4) and have different arguments. 1/1 1/1]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Grades</title><link href="https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/grades/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Grades" /><published>2022-12-15T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-15T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://jw95z.github.io/JeongWooLee/grades</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Grades_from_Lessons" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Section grades Lesson comments hacks 3.1 ~ 3.2 0.8/1.0 Lesson I didn’t know the date to submit , so I got late. 3.1-3.2 3.3 ~ 3.4 0.9/1.0 Lesson I just only do what I supposed to do.
