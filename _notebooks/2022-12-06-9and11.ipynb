There are many ways in coding to make same result. But, if the code is shorter, it will be more easy to understand or can teach to other people. If you know different kind of code that lead to same result, you can write each codes in proper situation.  Code is not just made by one person and codes are being complicated these days. \n",

But, if there is one mistake in just one code. The devices will not work well. The code is like a gear. If one gear in the clock is broken, the clock will stop. This is also same as codes.\n",
