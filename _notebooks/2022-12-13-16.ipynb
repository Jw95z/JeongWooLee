    "### writing example of simulation\n",
    "The simulation I am trying to write is Russian Roulette. After putting only one bullet into a six-shot revolver, turning the cylinder, and turning each other, they put the gun to their head and pull the trigger. If there are 1, 2, 3, or 6 factors of 6 playing the game, the odds of dying are the same. With any other number, the number of 6 attempts cannot be divided evenly, so there will inevitably be a person with a high probability of dying. If the person in front succeeds, the probability that the person behind will die increases, but since the probability of the person in front dying first and the probability of not dying because I shoot are combined, the probability of dying at the start of the game is fair. If no one has died by the 5th, the 6th chamber will of course contain bullets. There is also a rule to rotate the cylinder for each shot. In this case, regardless of the number of people, there is an equal 1/6 chance of death each turn, but if you can run away without shooting when all opponents are dead, the later you shoot, the more advantageous it is."
