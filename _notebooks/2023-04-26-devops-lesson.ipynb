    "2. Describe how you would be able to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "- I would be able to implement CORS into my own website maybe through my backend. I am aware that we did something with CORS in our flasks to help us with our backend\n",
    "3. Describe why you would want to implement CORS into your own websites\n",
    "- We should implement CORS into our websites because this can help protect our sites, and we should do it for our group website\n",

    "- If the system is operated by multiple administrators instead of one, and many people share the root password, it becomes difficult to change the root password regularly, and the probability of the root password being exposed to the outside increases relatively.\n",
    "2. What are some commands which allow us to look at how the storage of a machine is set up as?\n",
    "- \"diskmgmt.msc\": This command opens the Disk Management tool, which displays information about the disks and volumes on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"wmic logicaldisk get size,freespace,caption\": This command displays information about the size, free space, and name of each logical disk on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What do you think are some alternatives to running \"curl -O\" to get the zip file for KASM?\n",
    "- Alternatives to using \"curl -O\" to retrieve the zip file for KASM could include:\n",
    "- Using a web browser to download the zip file manually from the KASM website.\n",
    "- Using a download manager or wget command to retrieve the file.\n",
    "- Using a version control system like Git to clone the KASM repository directly.\n",
    "4. What kind of commands do you think the \"install.sh\" command has and why is it necessary to call it?\n",
    "- The install.sh command is typically a shell script used to install software or packages on a Unix-like operating system. This command is often used in conjunction with other command-line tools like apt-get on Ubuntu or yum on CentOS to automate the installation process and ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed.\n",
    "-Calling install.sh is necessary to ensure that the software or package is installed correctly and that all dependencies are met. The script takes care of all the necessary steps to set up the software, which can be a complex and time-consuming process if done manually. By running install.sh, the installation process is streamlined and automated, saving time and reducing the risk of errors or omissions in the installation process.\n",
    "5. Explain in at least 3-4 sentences how deploying KASM is related to/requires other topics talked about in the lesson and/or potential ways to add things mentioned in the lesson to this guide.\n",
    "- Deploying KASM involves various related topics and potential additions from the lesson, including:\n",
    "- Networking: Configuring network settings for KASM to ensure proper communication between the deployed application and other systems.\n",
    "- Security: Implementing appropriate security measures, such as setting up firewalls or using encryption protocols, to protect the deployed KASM instance.\n",
    "- System administration: Managing and monitoring the KASM deployment, performing updates, and troubleshooting issues.\n",
    "- Integration: Integrating KASM with other tools, frameworks, or services mentioned in the lesson, such as Docker containers, load balancers, or monitoring solutions, to enhance functionality and performance. Total: 0.2 points\n",
