    "1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\n",
    "2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.\n",

    "4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.\n",
    "5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.\n",
    "6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.\n",
    "7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.\n",
