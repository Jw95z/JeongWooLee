For example, if you call this function once and call it again exactly 1 second later, the two return values ​​will differ by 1.\n",

    "    - It refers to saving the Python object itself as a file, not the textual data. At this time, the desired object itself is stored in binary, and it has the advantage of being fast because it only needs to be called when needed.\n",
