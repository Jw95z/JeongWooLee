Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. | Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. | Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. | Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. | The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. | Working software is the primary measure of progress. | |",

Students are so stressed so they can’t make good opportunities. The stress takes its toll and it takes its toll in a way the students sometimes don’t want to admit. Many students are suffering at mental problems such as loneliness and depression. Science comes from two domains. One domain is this domain of positive psychology a field that literally studies happy people and other is the science of behavior change. Taking times in things that we like are built into the syllabus. We can control our happiness that we think and lot of this work comes from an idea that we tended think of people as being kind of a half glassful type person or a half empty kind of person.
