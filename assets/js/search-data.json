Challenge . This code segment is at a very early stage of implementation. . What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times while True: item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) total += menu[item] ans = input(&quot;do you want to order more?

Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? | What are some test cases that can be used? | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. | What are “single” tests that you will perform on your project? Or, your part of the project? As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding.

Programs are all developed a specific with specific purpose. | Developes follow specific steps and stick to their plan | Sometimes the development is more exploratory than anything, and the steps are dictated by what happens | . When we think about early AI projects or artificial intelligence, we abbreviate that to AI. Early on in this developers were just trying to figure out like hey, what is possible?, what can we make a computer do that would resemble intelligence. . Developes start investigating the problem/purpose and reflect . Investigation is an important step in the process. | Developers must determine the requirements of the program | Developers must understand the constraints | . One of the constraints is time you don’t have enough time to write this grand thing, you have to be very limited and very targeted about what you would accomplish. So understanding the constraints are a very important part of the investigative process. . Method of investigate . surveys | user testing | interviews | direct observations | . Developers design the program by . brainstorm | storyboarding the program | planning user experience | laying out the user interface | organizing into modules | develop a testing strategy | . Developers decide on the program requirements that . describe how a program should behave | include a list of user interactions | . The program specifications outline all of the requirements. Developers create a prototype of the program or components. An incremental process is frequently used so developers can refine small parts of the program . Testing, testing, and more testing . Developers test the program every step of the way . Testing occurs at the . micro level | macro level | . Developers refine and revise through testing, feedback, and reflection . Program development is rarely a solo endeavor . Programs are usually developed with by teams of people | Individuals and teams work on different functional components | Each member of the project deserves to receive credit for their work | Their names must be written in the documentation of the program indicating their contributors to the project | . The program should also be given credit where credit is due . Documentation is an important place to give credit . Many projects use comments within the programming language | Important part of the development of the program | When developers find a bug, they need to be able to determine who can fix the program | This may be most useful after a program is completed and users find additional bugs | . Many times developers use code segments, procedures, algorithms, and more than that are written by others. Similar to quoting someone in a research paper or article. . Reason of creating program documentation . describe the overall program | list program specifications | describe functions/procedures/methods within the code | specific code segments | list of events and corresponding outputs | the development of program | how other programs may interact with the program | . | list of contributors/authors of the program | . When does documentation happens . Documentation happens throughout the development of the program . At the beginning: list specifications | During: to keep track of process | After: to explain the overall process | improvement of documentation . efficiency of overall programming process | programmer’s ability to test and to refine the program | programmer’s response to bugs | . How do programmers document while programming . Most programming languages offer a commenting feature, although some do not. Commenting allows programming to write text within the program. This text does not affect the program. Comments are for programmers to read. This is a form of documentation and can be very useful when programmers collaborate or work individually. . example of comments . Text .

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software. | Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage. | Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale. | Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project. | Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done. | The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation. | Working software is the primary measure of progress. | Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. | Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility. | Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential. | The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. | At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. |",

Yale students are incredibly privileged to be at an amazing place like Yale with so many opportunities but they react to that with anxiety. Students are so stressed so they can’t make good opportunities. The stress takes its toll and it takes its toll in a way the students sometimes don’t want to admit. Many students are suffering at mental problems such as loneliness and depression. Science comes from two domains. One domain is this domain of positive psychology a field that literally studies happy people and other is the science of behavior change. Taking times in things that we like are built into the syllabus. We can control our happiness that we think and lot of this work comes from an idea that we tended think of people as being kind of a half glassful type person or a half empty kind of person. Unhappy people are spending time alone more than happy people. . Glitches . I think my whole life is my glitches. My heart is like a broken glass. . How to adapt . Just accept it and live. I just live because I don’t want to die. . Gratitude . I appreciated to my ELD teacher in last semester. Because of her, I could hear what teachers saying in the school. I was confused when I came to this school, but teacher teach me and communicate with me. . | I also thankful to staff of “league of legends”. I spend most of time in there.
