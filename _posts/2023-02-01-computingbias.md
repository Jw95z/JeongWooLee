## What age groups use Facebook vs â€¦ TikTok?

- In age of 16-24, 60% of people in US use Tiktok. 
- 23 % of people age to 25 and 34 uses Facebook. 
I know that many young people are using the Facebook and Tiktok. Tiktok is more dangerous because facebook is usually about the picture but tiktok is more about video. Moreover, young children are using this app and they sometimes do not have proper decision.


## Why do virtual assistants have female voices?
Using a female voice doesn't seem like a very good plan. Some people may want a female voice or a male voice, but deciding to use a female voice unconditionally can deepen the conflict between a woman and a man. In order to reduce femi culture and male and female problems, I think we need to fix these things first. 

## Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions
I think the algorithm is useful. It mainly finds the fields that the user is interested in, and occasionally finds information that I do not know. Without an algorithm, I would have great difficulty finding information. YouTube or Netflix brings me what I want, and Google allows me to enter the site with the information I want.

## HP computers are racist
If you look at the video, the black man's face is not recognized by KMera, but only the white woman's face is recognized. The camera seems to focus on skin color, but I think this is black discrimination. In addition to white people, there are also black people and Asian people. However, I think it is discrimination to think only of a few people without thinking about those people. And if it's a company's work, we should have thought more about consumers' thoughts.
