1. I'm trying to make something like Geometry dash. There is a character and the character have to jump over the obstacles. If controller press "Spacebar", the character will jump. If the character attach the obstacles, it would be dead.

2. Tetris, the random blocks are falling down in the square and player have to match the blocks and if the blocks reach to the ceiling, the game will be over
