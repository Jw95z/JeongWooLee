### Review
- Discrepancies in your scoring versus the ap scoring
    - My score and college score are very similar. I think I'm really talented in Professor or scoring student's score.
- what your program will need to fulfill all requirements
    - list has to be put to fulfill all requirements. Also, sequencing, iteration, selection too. 
- why a submission may have failed to meet the standard
    - I think because it has some missing subjects.
