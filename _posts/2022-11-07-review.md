## First Wrong
![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/test score.png)
- this is the first thing I got wrong.I did not see the exact meaning. I first pick D because the function was to put 30 when time is greater than 120 and else was to put 50. But I did wrong. It usually have to pick A. I have to set MaxPS to 50 and set MaxPS as 30 when the time was greater than 120.

1. wrong answer D: This code segment uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time > 120 and uses the ELSE statement to set maxPS to 50 otherwise.

2. correct answer A: This code segment sets maxPS to 50 by default, then uses the IF statement to set maxPS to 30 when time > 120.

## Second Wrong

-  This is the second thing I got wrong and this is also a same mistake with the first question. I thought I need to pick the word not a number when I saw the question. In the question, it says "The list wordList contains a list of 10 string values" and this attracts me. I thought string is a word, so I pick "hello". However, I didn't read the last part. The indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers, so it has to be the number which is not negative. 

1. incorrect answer B: While the list elements are strings, the indices of a list are typically nonnegative integers.

2. correct answer D: Correct. List indices are typically nonnegative integers. The exam reference sheet describes a list structure whose index values are 1 through the number of elements in the list, inclusive. So, 4 would be considered a valid index.
