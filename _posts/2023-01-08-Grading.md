|Program Purpose and Function|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked />Input <br>  <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />Program Functionality  <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />Output <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled /> Main goal in the program <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Functionality demonstrated in video <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Input and output shown in the video|Input and Output are clear. When the person enter three input, the degree of triangle with three inputs and table of sin, cos, tanz will be come out. However, the purpose is not that long. I want this student to write more specific. It would be better when this student writes why he makes or what he want to get.|0/1|0/1|
|Data Abstraction|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked />Two code segments <br>  <space><space> - one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type) <space><br> - one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />Name of the variables representing the list being used in response <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />what the data contained in this list is representing in the program <br>|Two code segments are shown. One is for the list and other is for how to use the list in procedure. This student defines the list well and explain how the list uses by giving the example in those codes.|1/1|1/1|
|Managing Complexity|<input type="checkbox" disabled />a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program<br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />How list manages complexity by explaining why the list have to written or what code will change without lists <br> |The code segment that contains list is not included in this response. There is a word about why the list makes more complicate.|0/1|0/1|
|Procedural Abstraction|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Two program code segment <br> - One provident that shows at least one effect parameter in the procedure <br> - one showing about calling of student's procedure|This student shows the code with three parameter and explains about the function called ratioCalculate. Besides, he shows full code so that it can make teacher to understand easily.|1/1|1/1|
|Algorithm Implementation|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Sequencing <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Selection <br> <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Iteration <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Describes what identified procedure is and how it contributes to overall functionality|This student uses the word conditionals, so I can see that student utilizes the selection. And there is order because A, B, and C have to be inputted. This student also portrays the steps very easily to comprehend, so person like me can also read this.|1/1|1/1|
|Testing|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Describes two calls that pass different argument and cause different result <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Conditions tested by each call <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> result of each call <br>|Results of each call are indicated and Conditions too. Inside the conditions, there are parameters too. At last, this students also expresses two calls which are ratioCalculate(3.0, 4.0, 5.0) and ratioCalculate(1.2, 2.3, 3.4) and have different arguments.|1/1|1/1|

The purpose is to serve entertainment to user. Functionality is well shown in this video.|1/1|1/1|

I think nextGrid can intimate the purpose of this project. I can see one variable in this code. It is written as gridsize.|1/1|1/1|
|Managing Complexity|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked />a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program<br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />How list manages complexity by explaining why the list have to written or what code will change without lists <br> |In this response, there are list that contains 10800 items. The writer refers that list is necessary in this code because it is hard to write those numerous numbers.|1/1|1/1|
|Procedural Abstraction|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Two program code segment <br> - One provident that shows at least one effect parameter in the procedure <br> - one showing about calling of student's procedure|I can see the parameters in code. |1/1|1/1|
|Algorithm Implementation|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Sequencing <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Selection <br> <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Iteration <br> <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Selection <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Describes what identified procedure is and how it contributes to overall functionality|I see sequencing and iteration in the code, but I cannot see selection. He explains definition of procedure and how it work in the code. This procedure that the student explained is about duplication and grid|0/1|1/1|
|Testing|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Describes two cells that pass different argument and cause different result <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Conditions tested by each cell <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> result of each call <br>|There are two calls and the students classify each two of those. Also, there are two conditionals that have different arguments. Lastly, results of each two calls are written in the last line. |1/1|1/1|
