## 1. Skills you have obtained
Before this class, I had no knowledge of coding, but through this class, I learned how to communicate with others and understand code. I wasn't good at coding. Therefore, in the second semester, I always stayed up all night to finish assignments or watched YouTube videos to broaden my knowledge of coding. Then, at some point, I came to understand the algorithm. Understanding the algorithm made me realize how the code worked and I could easily complete the assignment.
## 2. highs and lows from year
In the first semester, when I was doing computer science, I was in so much pain. I didn't know much about API and eventually passed with an A, but at the beginning of the second semester, I thought about giving up the computer science class. However, at the beginning of the second semester, there was a project about binary, and the teacher liked what I made, so our team was barely able to get a perfect score. Then I thought I should take up computer science again. Then, there was a project at the end of the second semester, and I got high grades there, so I became interested in computer science in earnest. My grade was 91% in the first semester, but it rose to 97% in the second semester. I feel that my skills have improved so much that I can raise 6% in one semester.
## 3. Future plans with CompSci
I am in 11th grade now. Sooner or later, you will have to look into college and there will be a lot of things to prepare for. I recently came to the United States from another country. Therefore, I didn't prepare much for college preparation compared to other students. I still want to go to college and major in computer science. And if possible, I want to go into game design. Ever since I was little, I wanted to get a job in gaming. My future in computer science is to go to university and study computer science and develop game engines or get hired as a programmer for a well-known game company.
## 4. future plans in Education/Career
Now I am looking for a lot of programs about coding. Besides, I teach coding to students during summer vacation and now I am doing an internship at a coding academy. I think what is lacking for me now is experience, so I will look at the algorithm as much as possible by looking at the code. Besides, I'm trying to take a lot of coding lectures now. Also, I think I need to know about computers in order to know more about computer science, so I am working as a volunteer at a computer fixing place.

## 5. Thanks to Mr. Mortensen
Thank you so much for the past year, and please take good care of me next year as well. I'm also determined to take the APCSP A next year, so I'll be able to see you again next year. I was able to become interested in computer science because my teacher looked at me favorably and gave me good grades. thank you.
