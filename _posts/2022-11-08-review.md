## Other peoples' project

- Our team was working on API. We spend many times in it, but it didn't work. I saw the group who made the site which related to NBA. In the site, people can search about NBA team. When we put the team's name, the results show the Abbreviation, City, Division, Likes, and Dislike. It was cool. They uses rapidapi.com to pull the information.

- I also see the other team's project. It was Chess game. The theme of the project was similar with my team. We made a quote api, but they have a simple Api which was about the moves and turns. They use python code to make the field and chess to move. 

## Reflection
After seeing other people's project, I feel lot of regrets. Usually, there are many struggles I got in APi. I don't how to make it or even use it. So, our group has to get 10 points in the final projects. I thought we have to make own API server by rapidapi.com. But some people made it by adding a list. It makes me poor and regretful.
