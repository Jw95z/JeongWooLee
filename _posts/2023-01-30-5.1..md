## Notes from 5.1
- Not every effect of computing innovation is anticipated in advance.
- Single effects can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person. ex) you can think Wii is great, but sometimes it is dangerous.
- People create computing innovations.
    - Even though 3D printer can make itself, someone has to make original 3D printer. Also, human have to put the parts together which are made by 3D printer.
- Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts
### Example of beneficial and harmful effects
- Multirotor
    - benefit: Deliveries, finding people, aerial photography is easy
    - harmful: privacy concerns, flying some zone is illegal and dangerous
- Wii controller

- It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used.
- Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer

### Digital divide
The digital divide refers to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geographic, or demographic characteristics
- Socioeconomic: how much money comes into the household per year
- Geographic: if you live where there is not many people, the ISPs will not provide high speed internet to your home.
- Demographic includes:
    - age: If you are little older and have no cellphone or any access, it doesn't matter to you
    - religion: when your friend live in a long distance and don't have computers and cars, but they still live and do things
#### Country
