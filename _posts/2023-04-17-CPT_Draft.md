## Purpose
I'm implementing a login system so people can create an account on our group's site, log in, and create their own schedule. Before logging in, there is an account creation process, so users can even create an account. In addition, if the user loses the password, I want to make it possible to change the password by authenticating based on the information about the birthday that was entered when the account was created.
