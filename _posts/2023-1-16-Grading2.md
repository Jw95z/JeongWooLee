|Program Purpose and Function|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked />Input <br>  <input type="checkbox" disabled />Program Functionality  <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />Output <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Main goal in the program <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Functionality demonstrated in video <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Input and output shown in the video| I think the purpose and input are clear, but how it works is not clear. You should write more about this|0/1|0/1|
|Data Abstraction|<input type="checkbox" disabled />Two code segments <br>  <space><space> - one that shows how data has been stored in this list (or other collection type) <space><br> - one that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />Name of the variables representing the list being used in response <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />what the data contained in this list is representing in the program <br>|I see the names or variables that the student represents. However, I cannot see the code that the student has to show|0/1|1/1|
|Managing Complexity|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked/>a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program<br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked />How list manages complexity by explaining why the list have to written or what code will change without lists <br> |It shows the list about animals and its picture. The student describes about the list and what happens while not using list. |1/1|0/1|
|Procedural Abstraction|<input type="checkbox" disabled /> Two program code segment <br> - One provident that shows at least one effect parameter in the procedure <br> - one showing about calling of student's procedure|The Program has a parameter and it affects the functionality but doesn't have a code segment showing this parameter or describe it.|0/1|1/1|
|Algorithm Implementation|<input type="checkbox" disabled /> Sequencing <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Selection <br> <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Iteration <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled/> Describes what identified procedure is and how it contributes to overall functionality|I saw selection and iteration on this code, but one is missing. I cannot see sequencing in this code. Also, the students didn't explain about functionality|0/1|0/1|
|Testing|<input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Describes two calls that pass different argument and cause different result <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> Conditions tested by each call <br> <input type="checkbox" disabled checked /> result of each call <br>|Fist call is about correct answer and second one is about wrong answer. There is two conditions which is required. Lastly, it tells the results about first call and second call|1/1|1/1|
