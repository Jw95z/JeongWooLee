## Vocab
Syllabus: an outline of the subjects in a course of study or teaching
## Notes
Yale students have a lot of stress. Yale students are incredibly privileged to be at an amazing place like Yale with so many opportunities but they react to that with anxiety. Students are so stressed so they can't make good opportunities. The stress takes its toll and it takes its toll in a way the students sometimes don't want to admit. Many students are suffering at mental problems such as loneliness and depression. Science comes from two domains. One domain is this domain of positive psychology a field that literally studies happy people and other is the science of behavior change. Taking times in things that we like are built into the syllabus. We can control our happiness that we think and lot of this work comes from an idea that we tended think of people as being kind of a half glassful type person or a half empty kind of person. Unhappy people are spending time alone more than happy people.

> ### How to adapt 
>   > Just accept it and live. ~~I just live because I don't want to die.~~
