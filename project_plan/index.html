<h2 id="feature">Feature</h2>
<p><img src="../images/result.png" alt="result" />
<img src="../images/codeforegister.png" alt="register" />
My feature is login and registration. Members who have registered on our site can log in from the login page and enter their account, and those who have not registered on the site will be able to register on the site and create their own new account.</p>

<h2 id="code-plan">Code plan</h2>
<p>The functions I am doing are login and membership registration. Once the user enters information with Python or JavaScript, it is uploaded to the database, and if the ID and password match the database, it exits the login page and returns to the original page. Also, if you already have an ID when signing up for membership, a duplicate ID will not be created, and if the ID and password do not match when you log in, a warning will be issued if the login fails.</p>

<h2 id="video-plan">Video plan</h2>
<p>In my video, I’ll show you how the site saves the input values ​​to the database and navigates to another page when the login is successful. If there is login information, the input will fail, and if the login is not a value in the database, the login will fail.</p>
